The app won't have a GUI. Instead it will monitor changes to shader and config files and apply them on the fly. Kind of like Sublime Text does with settings. It will preprocess shaders to allow using them in a modular manner, a lot like Fragmentarium but with less freedom (to support lookup cube and Oculus Rift transparently). A separate GUI is possible that will just work with these files.
