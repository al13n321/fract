Critical features:
- Saving everything to a file
- Runtime reloading and rebuilding of everything
- Cubemap
- Rift
- Windows

Important features:
- Loading values for uniforms from separate file

Plan:
- Check that interfaces make sense
- Loading shaders from configurable files at runtime
- Mandelbulb/mandelbox
- Preprocessor
- Normals, lighting, AO
- Saving everything to file (kernel, shader, camera)
- Lookup cube
- Loading uniforms from file at runtime
- Windows?
- Riiiiift!

Wishlist:
- Progressive enhancement
  + Progressively increasing cubemap resolution
  + Automaticaly adapting screen resolution for goal FPS?
- An space-style camera with no up and down
- Resizable window
- Changing image resolution on the fly
- Environment maps

Notes:
- Make cubemap resolution independent of screen resolution
- Limit quality degradation when using cubemap:
  use pixel size when tracing through cubemap;
  ignore cubemap texels that are too big on screen, including side hits
- Can use multiple OpenGL contexts for background rendering.
- Don't fuse raytracing with rendering! upscaling might work well.
- Cubemap face resolution is not image resolution; it depends on image FOV.
  Also, better make it even more for better quality
