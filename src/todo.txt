- Make sure cubemap lookup is worth the effort
- Look for a way to avoid OpenCL (GLSL syntax is much nicer in this case)
  + Precalculating cube in backgound might get complicated/impossible
- Note: don't fuse raytracing with rendering! upscaling might work well
- 3d sierpinski triangle
- Runtime compilation of kernel
- Mandelbulb/mandelbox
- Preprocessor
- Normals, lighting, AO
- Saving everything to file (kernel, shader, camera)
- Lookup cube
- Resizable window
- Loading uniforms from file at runtime
- Windows?
- Riiiiift!
