Critical features:
- Cubemap?
- Saving everything to a file
- Runtime reloading and rebuilding of everything
- Windows
- Rift

Important features:
- Loading values for uniforms from separate file

Plan:
- Make sure cubemap lookup is worth the effort
- Throw away OpenCL.
- 3d sierpinski triangle
- Runtime compilation of kernel
- Mandelbulb/mandelbox
- Preprocessor
- Normals, lighting, AO
- Saving everything to file (kernel, shader, camera)
- Lookup cube
- Loading uniforms from file at runtime
- Windows?
- Riiiiift!

Wishlist:
- An space-style camera with no up and down
- Resizable window

Notes:
- Can use multiple OpenGL contexts for background rendering.
- Don't fuse raytracing with rendering! upscaling might work well
- Cubemap face resolution is not image resolution; it depends on image FOV
