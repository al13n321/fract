- Stub RaytracingEngine and Renderer implementation, get it to compile
- Implement it almost for real
- Get stuff to work! Raytrace a cube; then a procedurally textured cube (will need it for debugging)
- Add a real DE tracer of some simple fractal (sierpinski?)
- Add scale to the camera
	+ figure out scaling details; need to avoid double precision as much as possible; at the very least for tracing results
- Improve stuff on all fronts
