Critical features:
- Saving everything to a file
- Runtime reloading and rebuilding of everything
- Cubemap
- Rift
- Windows

Important features:
- Loading values for uniforms from separate file

Plan:
- Check if double precision looks much better
- Mandelbulb
- Saving everything to file (shaders, camera)
- Preprocessor
- Normals, lighting, AO
- Lookup cube, precalcing synchronously, manually
- Loading uniforms from file at runtime
- Lookup cube rendering in background thread,
  automatically triggered by timeouts
- Windows
- Riiiiift!

Wishlist, to keep in mind:
- Progressive enhancement
  + Progressively increasing cubemap resolution
  + Automaticaly adapting screen resolution for goal FPS?
- An space-style camera with no up and down
- Resizable window
- Changing image resolution on the fly
- Environment maps
- Fix mouse movement initialization with low FPS
- Background precalc progress indication
- Rewinding movements
	+ Saving precalc checkpoints for faster re-rendering?

Notes:
- Limit quality degradation when using cubemap:
  use pixel size when tracing through cubemap;
  ignore cubemap texels that are too big on screen, including side hits
- Can use multiple OpenGL contexts for background rendering.
- Cubemap face resolution is not image resolution; it depends on image FOV.
  Also, better make it even more for better quality
